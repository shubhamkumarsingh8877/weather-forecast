4. Usage
Predicting Weather
To predict weather for a specific location and date, use the following command:
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --location "New York City" --date "2024-07-18"
Replace "New York City" with the desired location and "2024-07-18" with the date for prediction.
Training the Model
To train the weather prediction model:
bash
Copy code
python train.py --data-path "path/to/data.csv"
Replace "path/to/data.csv" with the path to your historical weather data file.

5. Data Flow
•	Data Collection: Retrieves historical weather data from APIs or databases.
•	Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw data into a format suitable for training.
•	Model Training: Trains machine learning models using preprocessed data.
•	Prediction: Uses trained models to predict weather conditions based on user inputs.

6. Prediction Model
The weather prediction model utilizes a combination of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, such as:
•	Linear Regression: For simple weather parameter predictions.
•	Random Forest: For more complex pattern recognition in weather data.
•	Neural Networks: Especially suited for time-series forecasting tasks.
